Manual answer paper evaluation is time consuming. To solve this issue,
we propose a system composed of a Deep Learning and a 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) model.
The Deep Learning model, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), performs handwriting recognition to
convert the answer paper into text. The resultant text is mapped
with a answer key. This new mapping is fed into an NLP model where
semantic evaluation is performed and the result is generated and
sent to individual students. Deep learning is used for handwriting 
recognition because the training data set is huge and it also 
provides better accuracy when Recurrent Neural Network models are used.
