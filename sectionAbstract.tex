Manual answer paper evaluation is time consuming. This is evident
from the current KTU evaluation system. To solve this issue,
we propose a system composed of a deep learning and an NLP model.
The deep learning model (LSTM) performs handwriting recognition to
convert the answer paper into text. The resultant text is mapped
with a answer key. This new mapping is fed into an NLP model where
semantic evaluation is performed and the result is generated and
sent to individual students. Deep learning is used for handwriting 
recognition because the training data set is huge and it also 
provides better accuracy when RNN models are used.
