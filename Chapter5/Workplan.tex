\noindent The duration of our project is from October 2019 to April 2019.
We categorized our project into different phases as follows. There
is a 2 month period for literature survey from October to November 2019.
From December 2019 to January 2020, the RNN model will be created and trained.
Parallelly, in January 2020 the separation of answers and mapping them
to the answer key is done. From January 2020 to February 2020,
the NLP model is created. In March 2020, the primary system is tested.
And finally in April 2020, performance evaluation is done.

\noindent Initially we have a planning phase which includes data collection and
cleaning phases. It is a 21 days duration phase starting from December 01 2019 to
December 30 2019. At the same time, the LSTM model design will take place from
Decemebr 12 2019 to December 30 2019 for a total of 21 days. The GUI design
is given 9 days from December 23 2019 to December 31 2019. The LSTM model training
takes place during December 21 2019 to January 21 2020. Parallelly, the
Question to Answer (Q2A) key mapping also takes place during January 01 2020
to January 07 2020 for a total of 7 days. The NLP model design, training and testing
takes place during the months of January 2020 to March 2020. Finally, the result generation
is done during April 2020 for a total of 21 days.
