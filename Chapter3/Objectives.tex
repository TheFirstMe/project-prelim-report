Answer script evaluation has always been a time-consuming task in our education
system. It particularly gets messy for the final year students in colleges. The evaluation should
be completed as soon as possible as the degree certificates are needed for most job applications.
The objectives of this project are given below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  A handwriting recognition system is needed to convert answer papers into digital
    text. Answer papers need to be converted to text so that it can be used for 
    semantic analysis with a NLP model. This technique involves the usage of a
    RNN architecture like a LSTM model.
    \item An NLP model is needed to perform semantic analysis with a predefined key.
    This model performs stemming on the answer text.
\end{enumerate}
The whole system should allow teachers to upload answer sheets and automatically evaluate
answer sheets and generate results and send them to individual students. All this must be
done in a time less than that of manual evaluation method.
