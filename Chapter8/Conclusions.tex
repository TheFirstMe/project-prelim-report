\section{Conclusions}
We presented a method to recognize handwritten texts using a system based on LSTM-RNN 
model widely applied to transcribe isolated text lines and is inspired from the recent
attention-based models. The answers recognized are fed to an NLP model along with the answer
key to evaluate the answer paper. 
\section{Future Work}
In future, we plan to provide features for sending answer
paper copies to student. We also plan to carry out revaluation results. This project can be
extended to work with other applications like handwriting recognition of medical prescriptions.
